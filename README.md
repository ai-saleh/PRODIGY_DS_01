# Global Population and Migration Trends Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global population and migration trends using data from the World Bank. It explores population distribution changes, growth rates, and migration patterns from 1960 to 2023, providing insights into demographic shifts and their potential implications for policy and planning.

2. Data Import and Preparation
3. Population Distribution Analysis
4. Population Growth Rate Analysis
5. Migration Rate Analysis
6. Conclusion

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Data

The project uses two datasets from the World Bank:
1. `world_bank_population.csv`: Contains population data for countries from 1960 to 2023.
2. `world_bank_migration.csv`: Contains migration rate data for countries from 1960 to 2023.

Ensure these files are in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter notebook file.
2. Ensure you have the required datasets in the same directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Findings

- Global population has shown a clear increase from 1960 to 2023.
- There's growing diversity in country population sizes over time.
- Population growth rates have fluctuated significantly, with decreasing variability in recent years.
- Migration rates show notable fluctuations, particularly from the 1980s onwards.
