# Population and Migration Data Analysis

## Introduction
This small project analyzes population growth and migration trends using historical data from *1960* to *2023*. It explores how population distributions and migration patterns have evolved, highlighting key insights such as growth rates and demographic changes. This study provides a clearer picture of how global demographics have shifted over the decades, influenced by various socioeconomic and political factors.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `Population_Distribution_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.
- `population_data.csv`: CSV file containing the population data from *1960* to *2023*.
- `migration_data.csv`: CSV file containing the migration data from *1960* to *2023*.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Analysis Overview
### Histograms of Population Distribution
Histograms visualize the population distributions over three key periods: *1960-1979*, *1980-1999*, and *2000-2023*. The histograms reveal a shift towards higher population ranges over time, reflecting significant global population growth and increased diversity in population sizes.

### Population Growth Rates
Population growth rates from *1960* to *2023* are analyzed. The growth rate plot shows periods of rapid growth and decline, highlighting the dynamic nature of global demographics influenced by various factors such as economic development and policy changes.

### Migration Rates
Migration rates over the years are examined, revealing fluctuating patterns with noticeable peaks and troughs corresponding to historical events and policy shifts.

## Key Insights
1. **Global Growth Trend**: The histograms show a clear trend of increasing population sizes over the decades, with more countries moving into higher population brackets.
2. **Increasing Diversity**: More recent years show a wider distribution of population sizes, reflecting varied growth rates and demographic changes across different countries.
3. **Dynamic Demographics**: Population growth rates and migration patterns highlight the dynamic nature of global demographics, influenced by economic, social, and political factors.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals a clear trend of global population growth and increasing diversity in country sizes. The histograms show a shift towards higher population ranges over time, with significant growth observed from *2000* to *2023*. Population growth rates reflect dynamic changes influenced by economic development and policy shifts, while migration rates reveal fluctuating patterns tied to historical events. These insights underscore the importance of understanding demographic changes for future planning and policy-making.
