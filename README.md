# Population Distribution Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the distribution of the world's population by country using data from the World Bank. The goal is to create visual representations, such as bar charts or histograms, to better understand population trends across different regions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the World Bank and contains information on the total population of various countries over multiple years. The file should be named `world_bank_population.csv`.

## Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Skipping unnecessary rows, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to illustrate population distribution. This includes:
   - Bar charts
   - Histograms
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the visualizations to draw meaningful insights about the population distribution.
